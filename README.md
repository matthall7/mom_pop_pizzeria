Login As Admin:
Instead of creating a customer and entering a phone number, you can log in using the admin login.
Switch the combo box at the top of the login screen to admin, and enter the password: 123

When Creating an Account:
The file database works best when either options are entered for customer details:
 - Only the phone number and name
 - Every possible box: phone number, name, street, city, state, zipcode, card number, expiration date, CVV

Account Information:
The account information button (Account button on the red banner) takes you to a menu where the user should be able to
alter or add information. This is currently not functional.
